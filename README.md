# Real time Crud app node angular mongodb socket.Io

# Key Points:
addItem(): Adds a new item to the list. The newItem.name is cleared after the item is added.
editItem(): Prompts the user to edit the item's name, then updates the item.
deleteItem(): Deletes the item after confirming the action with the user.
This completes the setup for the frontend part of the real-time CRUD application. With the HTML template and corresponding TypeScript methods, the Angular component will be able to interact with the backend, reflecting real-time updates across different systems.
